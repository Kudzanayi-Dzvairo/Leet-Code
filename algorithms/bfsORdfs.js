//If you know the solution is not far from the root of the tree
bfs

//If the tree is very deep and the solutiosn are rare
bfs (dfs will take too long)

//if the tree is very wide 
dfs (bfs will need too much memory)

//if the solutions are frequent but located deep in the tree
dfs

//determining whether a pathe exists between two nodes
dfs

//finding the shortest path
