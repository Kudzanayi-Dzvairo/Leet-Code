You have an app which you need to have display the temperature:

getTemperatureUrl(urls).then(displayTemperature);

It turns out the temperature API can be flaky, so your product team comes up with a list of backup URLs. You are provided an array of URLs that is ordered from most accurate to least accurate:

    temperatureUrlArray = [
        “best-data.json”,
        "average-data.json" ,
        “worst-data.json”
    ];

Implement the function getTemperatureUrls, which takes an array of URLs (strings) and resolves the best temperature from the array of URLs.

function getTempertureUrl(urls) {
            
if(urls.length === 0){
   return
}

fetch(urls[0])
.then(response => response.json())
.catch((error) => {
	urls.shift()
	getTemperatureUrls(urls)
})


}







function getTemperatureUrl(urls) {

for(let i = 0; i < urls.length; i++){
fetch(urls[i])
.then(response => response.json())
.catch((error) => {
	console.log(error)
})

   }

}

Interviewer notes:

getTemperatureURLs([A, B, C]) -> getting A fails
now we want B, and we have a way to get the first element in a url array
getTemperatureURLs([B, C]) -> getting B fails
getTemperatureURLs([C]) -> C fails

new Promise((resolve, reject) =>  {
  for (...) {
   … .then(res => res.json()).then(data => resolve(data))
  }
});
